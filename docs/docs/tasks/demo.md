title: Demo mode
---

Do you want to train your skills or to invent a new way of trading? 
There is a demo subprofile for this. You can see real market data: prices, trades and orderBooks. 
you can trade with huge amount of virtual money. 
Please, note, that I call it subprofile because you really need to set up a profile 
before making demo subprofile. 
Profile should have real api keys from your exchange's account. 
This is the only way to receive real market data from exchange. 
After that all trading operations will be emulated by the app.

In demo mode, when you (or the bot) place orders they are only processed internally on the server and your demo balance is recounted. Everything works exactly like a real exchange and also includes margin and leverage.
