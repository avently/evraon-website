## Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how Evraon collects, uses, shares, and protects user information obtained through software made by Evraon developers. The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Evraon developers.
We ask for certain personal information from users just because this information is needed for providing a service that users want to get. 

The information we ask for is:
- API keys and API secrets for account on exchanges;
- email address, username, password for creating Evraon Account;
- logins and passwords for user's servers that he or she can run by using our software;
- contacts provided by the user;
- payments details as well as information about payment methods;
- service usage information;
- third-party services may collect information about payments that was made through them.

API Keys will never be transfered to any place except exchanges that the user wants to connect to. Keys will be stored locally in a place user choose.

Username, email and password are used to securely store information about the User in account. It allows to use the same account on different devices and to get all features the User paid for on all devices.

Logins and passwords are needed to provide a security layer between user's server and the world outside. By "server" we mean a part of the software that is used to make tasks like making orders, viewing market prices, etc. Logins and passwords are stored locally in a place user choose.

We store as little information about payments methods as possible.

Service usage information is an information like:
- crash reports;
- tracking information related to usage such as date & time, device type, IP address, actions user makes in the software. This information may be directly obtained by Evraon or through third party services. This service usage data helps us to ensure that our software and services are accessible for users across all platforms. We use the information collected to protect our platform, to measure site performance and usability of the software.  

We use personal information collected, like an email address to interact with users directly when providing customer support on a message from the user.

Evraon has implemented a number of security measures to ensure that your information is not lost, abused, or altered. Please note that it is impossible to guarantee 100% secure transmission of data over the Internet nor method of electronic storage. As such, we request that you understand the responsibility to independently take safety precautions to protect your own personal information.
