After installation you will be able to setup the server and app without problems and with instructions.

### Linux/Windows/Mac
[Github](https://github.com/avently/evraon/releases/download/v1.0/evraon.jar)

Ensure you have installed Java: [can be downloaded here](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).

Create new directory, e.g, on desktop. Then type in a terminal:
```
java -jar 
```
there is a space after -jar. Move jar file inside the terminal window and press enter.

You'll get something like this (Linux):
```
java -jar /home/user/Desktop/evraon/evraon.jar
```

Server will be started. Since then you'll be able to connect to it via mobile app.

#### How to connect to the server with the mobile app:
- add new server
- enter IP address of the computer you use (where the server have been working). Usually it looks like 192.168.1.x. Enter a port 5515
- Provide username and password. You can find them after first start inside server.json. They are randomly generated for every installation.

That's it, you can connect now to the server.
