Do you want to train your skills or to invent a new way of trading? There is a demo mode for this. You see real market data: prices, trades, orderBook. And you can choose any amount of money on the demo account - this amount should be choosen inside a settings of demo mode.
So you (or the bot) are placing orders but they are not leaving your server. 
Wherein all orders will be processed by the server and balance will be recounted. Everything works like on a real exchange. Even margin and leverage can be used.
